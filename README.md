## Usage
Usage is as simple as it can get! No configs, no flags, just a terminal and running:
```
christmasfetch
```

## Installation
- **NOTE:** at the moment, this is a Linux-only tool as it requires /usr/bin to be present. You can likely modify this to fit your OS without any big problems, though!
- `git clone https://github.com/mattishere/christmasfetch.git && cd christmasfetch`
- `make install` (note: you may have to run this as root)

## Some highlights
- Over 70 gift ideas (some are quite odd! I hope you like alpacas and... land?)
- Randomly colored lights (`*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*`)
- A little message on Christmas day :)

## To do:
- More themes
- An easier way to add more themes
- More information about Christmas
- More gift ideas

## Uninstallation
- Go into the cloned repository
- Run `make uninstall` (note: you may have to run this as root)

## Merry Christmas!
I hope you have a lovely Christmas, and I hope you enjoy my little program :)
